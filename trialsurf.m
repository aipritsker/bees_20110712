% This code calculates the surface for honey collected based
% on the number of bees involved in collection, and stores
% it in a matrix that we can later use for interpolation.
% This will significantly speed up the model.

% H = stage(5)
% F = stage(6)

% The larger Hn and Fn, the more accurate your interpolation

Hn = 20; Fn = 20;
global hsurfX hsurfY hsurf;

% 
% x and y are the ranges for stage(5) and stage(6).
% The code has a problem if we plug 0 into the ODE's below, so we
% start at 1.  I'm just guessing that 4000 is a large enough
% upper bound, but this may need to be increased.
H = 10.^linspace(1,4,Hn);
F = 10.^linspace(1,4,Fn);

hsurfY=F;

		Hi = H(i);
		Fj = F(j);
		predictedhoney = honeycollection( H(i), F(j) );
