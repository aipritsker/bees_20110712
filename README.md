bees_20110712
=============

This is an old version of Wanyi's code from 2011 that

This version seems to create curves that are identical to the ones in Wanyi's thesis, but
at the same time, it is a bit simpler than some other code.
It's not super user-friendly, so I have created a version that should give the same outputs as this one,
while being structured hierarchically.  That can be found in the repo Original_WanyiThesis

The biggest issue with this version is that this version has the following biological mistakes in it:
1. all of the bees go for pollen
2. all of the bees ALSO go for honey
